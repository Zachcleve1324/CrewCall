# CrewCall

"CrewCall" is an app designed to promote accountability and support among friends by facilitating regular check-ins. Users can create a virtual "crew" or group of friends within the app. Each day, CrewCall prompts users to reach out to a designated friend from their crew for a check-in phone call. The app tracks and displays who has and hasn't made their daily call, encouraging users to connect and stay accountable to their friends. Through these check-ins, CrewCall fosters a supportive community where users can discuss their well-being, share struggles, and offer encouragement to one another.
